      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this date 65 years ago, February 1st 1953, the Netherlands experienced its
greatest flood till date, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_flood_of_1953&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;North Sea Flood of 1953&lt;/a&gt;. This
is still one of the biggest disasters the Netherlands has ever experienced,
with thousands of casualties and lots of people who lost their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands earns its name from the fact that large parts of the country
lie below sea level. To make sure our country doesn&amp;rsquo;t flood, we have built lots
of barriers, dams and dykes to keep the water out, and we want to prevent
anything like the flood of 1953 from happening ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of this year, several of these barriers and dams were put to
the test when a heavy storm reached the Netherlands which resulted in very high
water levels. Our five biggest dams and barriers needed to be closed at the
same time, a first since their construction. We can ask ourselves the question
whether this will happen more often now that sea levels are rising due to
global warming &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:sealevel&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:sealevel&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A higher base line sea level increases the chance
for even higher water levels when it storms. To get an idea what areas would be
affected the most by a possible flood, we have created a visualisation project
that shows the height of the Netherlands in comparison to the sea level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drawing arbitrary shapes with OpenGL points</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part of my Google Summer of Code project involves porting several arrow
heads from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/glumpy/glumpy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Glumpy&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vispy.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vispy&lt;/a&gt;. I also want to make a slight change to them:
the arrow heads in Glumpy include an arrow body, I want to remove that
to make sure you can put an arrow head on every type of line you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making a change like that requires that you understand how those shapes
are drawn. And for someone without a background in computer graphics this took some thorough
investigation of the code and the techniques used. This article is aimed
at people like me: good enough programming skills and linear algebra
knowledge, but almost no former experience with OpenGL or computer
graphics in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
